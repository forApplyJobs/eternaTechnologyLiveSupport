This project aims to create a live support app skeleton for future projects,that consist live messaging and peer to peer connection Video Calls.

Since it's my first laravel and vue project implementation might be poor at some points.

VideoCall done with WebRTC and signalling happens via Pusher. Other stuff i used are Laravel Echo and Tailwind for styling.

Followed tutorials :
